# Computer Vision Project
## Milestone 2
### Task 1 & 2
For this task I was asked to create an image project model on Teachable-Machine showing images of me holding up a Rock/Paper/Scissors or nothing to train the model. I then downloaded it and pushed it to Github.

## Milestone 3
For this milestone I was tasked to create a `conda` environment and install `opencv-python`, `ipykernel` and `tensorflow` and their dependencies.

## Milestone 4
For this milestone I was tasked to create a Python script that would simulate a Rock-Paper-Scissors game. 

This was pretty straightforward task which included use of functions and if/else statements.
